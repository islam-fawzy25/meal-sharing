            <p> A meal can be much more than the simple intake of food: a quite sociable act and, beyond that,
                a way of celebrating a special occasion, for example, a birthday or a wedding.
                A dinner invitation (be it for a meeting in a restaurant or at home) is traditionally a common
                method of socializing â€” practiced not only in the personal arena but also in business. The exchange of
                a conference table with a lunch table (mainly in restaurants) often provides a break for all meeting participants,
                can signal the end of a particular business session or be a welcome
                icebreaker to loosen up the atmosphere.</p>
